/*
Problem: Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order and an integer target.
Write a function to search target in nums. 
If target exists, then return its index. 
Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 */

// IN -> number[], number(target)
// OUT -> number(index)
